### Routes in NavbarRouter

When it comes to routing from a widget which has a Navbar setup it is important to decide whether the Navbar should persist on pushing a route or not. If the Navbar needs to be hidden then the route should be pushed onto the Flutter's Navigation stack (on top of NavbarRouter). But if we want the Navbar to persist then we should push the route ontop of the existing route (Within NavbarRouter).

Navbar add its own Navigator to each NavbarItem

For instance consider rough diagram of Navbar with 3 Navbar items.
