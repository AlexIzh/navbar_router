Snackbar is a component that is used to display a message for a short period of time and then automatically disappear. It can be used to display a short message or an action that a user has performed. It is a good way to give feedback to the user.

Showing Snackbar with NavbarRouter is very easy. You just need to use the `showSnackbar` method of the `NavbarRouter`. The `showSnackbar` method requires a context and a message.

```dart
NavbarNotifier.showSnackBar(
  context,
  "This is shown on top of the Floating Action Button",
);
```

And hide it using the `NavbarNotifier.hideSnackBar` method.

```dart
NavbarNotifier.hideSnackBar(context);
```
